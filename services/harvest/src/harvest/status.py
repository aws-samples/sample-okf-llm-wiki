"""Report harvest lifecycle status back to the DynamoDB registry.

The Control API writes the ``HARVEST#<domain>#<dataset> / STATUS`` row as
``queued`` when it invokes the runtime, but it can't know when the agent
actually starts, finishes, or fails — the crawl runs here, inside AgentCore. So
the AGENT owns the lifecycle after ``queued``: ``running`` when it picks the job
up, then ``complete`` on success or ``failed`` (with a short detail) on error.
This is what the UI's ``GET /harvest`` polls (docs/CONVENTIONS.md item shape).

Two rules this module enforces:

* **UpdateItem, not PutItem.** The ``queued`` row already carries ``mode``,
  ``started_at`` and ``runtime_session_id``; we must touch only ``status`` /
  ``updated_at`` / ``detail`` so those aren't clobbered. (UpdateItem also creates
  the row if a harvest was triggered out-of-band without a ``queued`` row.)
* **Best-effort.** A registry write must NEVER crash a harvest — the S3 commit
  marker is the durable source of truth for consumability. Every failure here is
  swallowed and logged.

    ``detail`` / ``model`` / ``effort``) are written; ``mode`` / ``started_at`` /
    ``runtime_session_id`` set at ``queued`` time are preserved. Never raises.

    ``model``/``effort`` record the RESOLVED LLM config actually used for this run
    (override or deploy-time default) so the UI can show what a harvest ran on.
    Written on the ``running`` transition (the runner knows the resolved config by
    then); passing them on other transitions just re-stamps the same values.

    ``only_if_active`` guards the write with a condition that the row is still
    ``queued`` or ``running`` — used for the terminal ``complete``/``failed``
    transitions so they never CLOBBER a ``cancelled`` row. When an operator
    cancels, the Control API stops the AgentCore session; the crawl thread then
    typically dies with an exception (e.g. ``cannot schedule new futures after
    shutdown`` from the torn-down QuickJS worker) and the runner tries to report
    ``failed`` — this guard makes that a no-op so the status stays ``cancelled``.
    A rejected conditional write is expected here, not an error.
